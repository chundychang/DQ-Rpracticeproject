# Introduction

This is my solution to Dataquest's Guided Project from the first Data Cleaning in R course, which analyzes survey responses on quality perceptions of NYC schools. This analysis focuses on answering two questions:

1. Do student, teacher, and parent perceptions of NYC school quality appear to be related to demographic and academic success metrics?
2. Do students, teachers, and parents have similar perceptions of NYC school quality? 

More details such as the RMD and csv files can be found in the [repository in GitHub](https://github.com/chundychang/DQ-Rpracticeproject). Details about the variables can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8).


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, results = 'markup', message = F)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = F)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(scientific=T, digits = 3) 
# options(scipen=9, digits = 3) 
# ‘scipen’: integer. A penalty to be applied when deciding to print numeric values in fixed or exponential notation.  Positive values bias towards fixed and negative towards scientific notation: fixed notation will be preferred unless it is more than ‘scipen’ digits wider.
# use scipen=999 to prevent scientific notation at all times
```

```{r pkg, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tibble)
library(DT)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

# Findings

## Step 1: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
