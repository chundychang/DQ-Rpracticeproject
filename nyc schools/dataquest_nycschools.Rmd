# Introduction

This is my solution to Dataquest's Guided Project from the first Data Cleaning in R course, which visually examines the occurrence of forest fires in a Portugal park using the `ggplot2` package. 

More details such as the RMD and csv files can be found in the [repository in GitHub](https://github.com/chundychang/DQ-Rpracticeproject). Details about the variables can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8).


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
